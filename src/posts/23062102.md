To my friend,

I hope you have been doing well through these years. 
Thank you for being my guide through life's crossroads, 
for being my fuel to power through life's hurdles, 
for being my goal to aspire. 

The times we were together were splendid, 
and I would not change it for a thing.
As much as I make the conscious effort,
you are not someone I forgot.

With our chapter closed prematurely,
I was at a loss.
Everything in my power to stop it,
but I was blind to life's changes.

For there are countless stars in the skies,
there are countless ways to say it,
but I can only muster up a 'thanks',
Thanks, and rest in peace.

For my friend up there, now and forever.
